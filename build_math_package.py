"""
Build script to generate Stake Math SDK package files for Full Court Fortune.
Produces:
- math/_index.json
- math/full_court_base.jsonl.zst
- math/lookup_base.csv

Conforms to https://stakeengine.github.io/math-sdk/rgs_docs/data_format/
Key fields per round: id, events, payoutMultiplier (integer)

This version generates EXACTLY 5000 outcomes with:
- 1-in-1,000,000 chance of 5000x (jackpot)
- Equal probability distribution across the remaining 4,999 outcomes
- Majority of spins are losses (0x outcomes > 50% probability)
- Target RTP of 94% (exactly 0.94 expected multiplier)
